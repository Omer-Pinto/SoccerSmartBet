# Smart AI Soccer Betting System

A **non-monetary, AI-assisted daily soccer game betting system** where both AI and user compete by placing simulated bets on selected daily matches. Powered by rich real-time data, structured analysis, and LangGraph orchestration.

---

## System Architecture

The system is organized around **four main application flows**, each responsible for a distinct stage of the daily soccer-betting lifecycle:

![System Architecture Diagram](./resources/app_flows.png)

### Daily Execution Flow

| Flow | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Pre-Gambling** | Daily wall-clock schedule (IST) | Select games, fetch data, build reports |
| **Gambling** | After Pre-Gambling completes | Collect bets from user and AI via Telegram |
| **Post-Games** | Auto-triggered: max(kickoff) + 3h | Fetch results, compute P&L |
| **Offline Analysis** | On-demand | Generate statistics and insights |

---

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Runtime** | Python 3.13 |
| **Graph Engine** | LangGraph 1.x (Send() API for parallelism) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 (Docker, port 5433, TZ=Asia/Jerusalem) |
| **Telegram UI** | python-telegram-bot |
| **Operator Dashboard** | FastAPI + Uvicorn, vanilla JS (ES modules), custom DSL filter engine |
| **AI Models** | OpenAI gpt-5.4 / gpt-5.4-mini |
| **Data Sources** | FotMob (custom signed client), football-data.org, winner.co.il, The Odds API, Open-Meteo |
| **Scheduling** | Wall-clock polling (60s asyncio loop, macOS sleep resistant) |

---

## Core Concepts

### Betting Model

- **3 outcomes per game**: `'1'` (home win), `'X'` (draw), `'2'` (away win)
- **Single bets only** (no combinations)
- **Variable stakes**: 50, 100, 200, or 500 NIS per game (chosen per bet)
- **Starting bankroll**: 10,000 NIS each (user and AI)
- **P&L calculation**: Win = stake × (odds − 1) | Loss = −stake (Israeli Toto format)

### Game Selection

Games are selected by cross-referencing football-data.org fixtures against winner.co.il odds, filtered via LLM-assisted selection to ensure meaningful betting opportunities.

---

## Application Flows

### 1. Pre-Gambling Flow

Runs daily to prepare the betting environment:

1. **Game Selection** (`smart_game_picker`) — cross-refs football-data.org fixtures × winner.co.il odds, LLM filters for interesting games
2. **Persist Games** — saves selected games to DB
3. **Parallel Data Fetching** — Send() fan-out: each game runs an `analyze_game` subgraph with three parallel branches (game intelligence, home team intel, away team intel)
4. **Report Generation** — combines branch results, LLM generates expert HTML reports
5. **Persist Reports** — saves reports to DB
6. **Telegram Notification** — sends gambling time message, HTML reports, and "Want to bet?" prompt

### 2. Gambling Flow

Manages the betting process:

1. **Load Reports** — fetches today's games and reports from DB
2. **User Bet** — Telegram inline buttons: 1/X/2 per game + variable stake selection; user submits via SEND BET
3. **AI Bet** — AI agent places independent bets with variable stakes and written justifications
4. **Validation & Persistence** — verifies and persists both bets; cancels day if deadline missed
5. **Summary** — comparison message sent to Telegram showing user vs. AI selections

### 3. Post-Games Flow

Settles the day's bets:

1. **Fetch Results** — FotMob `overviewFixtures` for real-time final scores
2. **Compute P&L** — won = stake × (odds − 1), lost = −stake
3. **Update DB** — persists results
4. **Daily Summary** — Telegram message with outcome per game and running P&L for user and AI

### 4. Offline Analysis Flow

On-demand analytics:

- Query success rates and P&L breakdowns
- Team and league statistics
- AI-generated insights and explanations

## Data Collection

### Implemented Tools

**11 tools** currently implemented across 5 data sources:

| Tool | Type | Source |
|------|------|--------|
| `fetch_daily_fixtures` | Game | football-data.org |
| `fetch_h2h` | Game | football-data.org |
| `fetch_venue` | Game | FotMob |
| `fetch_weather` | Game | FotMob + Open-Meteo |
| `fetch_odds` | Game | The Odds API |
| `fetch_winner_odds` | Game | winner.co.il |
| `fetch_form` | Team | FotMob |
| `fetch_injuries` | Team | FotMob |
| `fetch_league_position` | Team | FotMob |
| `calculate_recovery_time` | Team | FotMob |
| `fetch_team_news` | Team | FotMob |

**Tool Interfaces:**
- **Game tools** (6): Accept `(home_team, away_team)` — called once per match
- **Team tools** (5): Accept `(team_name)` — called twice per match (home + away)

### Data Sources

| Source | API Key | Used For |
|--------|---------|----------|
| FotMob (custom signed client, x-mas header) | None | Form, Venue, Injuries, Standings, Recovery, Team News, Results |
| football-data.org | Required | Daily Fixtures, H2H |
| winner.co.il | None (session cookies) | Israeli Toto odds (1X2) |
| The Odds API | Required | International odds |
| Open-Meteo | None | Weather forecasts |

> **Design principle**: Subflows are modular and extendible. New fetchers can be added as nodes to game/team subflows.

## Operator Dashboard

A self-hosted web dashboard at `/today`, `/history`, `/pnl`, `/team/{slug}`, `/league/{slug}` for monitoring the system, reviewing bets, and analysing performance. Hosted by the same FastAPI process that runs the Telegram bot.

### Today — Matchday Console (live)

Live updates each minute via FotMob: score, period chip (1H / HT / 2H / FT) with match minute, pulsing dot on in-play games. P&L is suppressed for in-progress bets; on FT it is computed on-the-fly from the final score so it is visible before the post-games flow has settled the row in DB. Today's Scoreboard splits into LIVE / PENDING / FINAL with live in-play P&L estimates per side. Inline EDIT preserved — chip ticker pauses while a row is being edited so the UI does not jitter.

![Today page — live scores, bets, scoreboard](./docs/images/today_live.png)

### History — Bet History with chip-based DSL filter

Side-by-side User / AI stats (totals, win-rate, P&L) + the full bet table with results.

![History page — baseline](./docs/images/history.png)

A custom token / chip filter builder generates a DSL string (e.g. `league:"La Liga" outcome:home_win odds:>2.0`) which the backend parser + compiler (`src/soccersmartbet/webapp/query/`) turns into a parameterised SQL `WHERE`. Category values autocomplete from `/api/filter/values?key=…`; multi-select inside one chip = OR (`league:pl,bundesliga`); chips combine across categories = AND. Same-key range clauses (e.g. two `date:` bounds) AND-merge so date windows behave correctly. The free-text DSL input is gone — the chip builder makes "Malformed DSL" unreachable.

![History page — DSL filter chips](./docs/images/history_filter_dsl.png)

### P&L — Cumulative Bankroll

Y-axis is the actual bankroll, starting from 10,000 NIS — not deltas. Two lines (User, AI) plot the running balance per evaluated day. The status strip surfaces current balance and date range. Hover (in-app) shows total NIS, daily diff, and percent change from the starting bankroll.
